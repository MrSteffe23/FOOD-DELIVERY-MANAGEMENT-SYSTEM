# Food-Delivery-Management-System
I implemented a food delivery management system for a catering company. The client can order products from the company's menu. The
system have three types of users that log in using a username and a password: administrator, regular employee and client.
Each user can make some actions like: adding or deleting a product, generating reports (the administrator), searching for a specific product
(the client) or just receiving a notification for a new order (the employee).
I used lambda expressions, stream processing and serialization in this project.
